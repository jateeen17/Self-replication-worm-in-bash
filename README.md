# Self-replication-worm-in-bash

Overview

A computer worm is a malicious program that replicates itself across computer networks without any
human intervention.
For this project I've built a computer worm that steals cookies from any remote host that it infects,
and sends it to the attacking device.
Stolen cookies allow an attacker to perform a session hijacking attack, granting access to accounts and
bypassing the need for passwords or OTPs.
